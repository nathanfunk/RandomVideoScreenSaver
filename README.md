RandomVideoScreenSaver
======================

Windows screen saver that plays random videos within a directory

I started this project because I wanted a screen saver that could play all the home videos of our kids we are accumulating over time. I love watching random memories casually while we're hanging out in the living room. Such a great use of the computer screen when nobody is working on it.
